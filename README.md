# E-Commerce Web App

## Project Overview

The **E-Commerce Web App** is a modern shopping platform built with React and TypeScript. It leverages Redux Toolkit for state management and Firebase Firestore for product and order data. Users can browse products, manage their shopping cart, and complete a simulated checkout process. Authentication is handled through Firebase Authentication.
